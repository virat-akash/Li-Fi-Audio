**Project:** Li-Fi Audio / Communication Demo  
**Author:** Akash Pattanayak

## Overview
This project demonstrates a Li-Fi (Light Fidelity) audio/communication prototype using LED optical transmission and photodiode reception. The repository contains slides, diagrams, circuit schematics, code, and demo files.

## Contents
- `slides/` - presentation (PPTX / PDF)
- `diagrams/` - circuit diagrams and block diagrams (PNG)
- `schematics/` - breadboard / PCB layout images
- `README.md` - this file

## How to view
- Open `slides/Li-Fi-presentation.pptx` to view the PPT.
- See `diagrams/` for wiring and block diagrams.

## Setup (brief)
1. Connect transmitter LED and receiver photodiode as per `diagrams/circuit.png`.
2.Audio connected  to LED transmitter.LED light beam directed  towards  photodiode.
3.Photodiode  connected  to amplifier & speaker. Audio successfully  reproduced on speaker.
